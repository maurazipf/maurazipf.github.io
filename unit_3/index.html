	<p> Hi, my name is Maura. While attending school, I worked in a restaurant for 5 years as a hostess, waitress and interim manager. Everything excited me... the environment, the people, the challenge, and of course, the food! After graduating college I began working at a Digital Marketing Agency and discovered that I love social media and the power of it. The main platform that I enjoy is Instagram and in working in the industry, website development also interested me. Many people don't understand Instagram, so when explaining it I say: A picture is worth a thousand words, so an Instagram feed, the home page of a brand or a person, features 9 images... 9,000 words! I figured, since I love the restaurant and food industry so much, and want to embrace the power of social and websites... why not combine them all? </p>


	<p>Here you will find:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>my images for the 'gram </li>
		<li>my reviews of the restaurants that I took them in </li>
		<li>whether I think the restaurant is worthwhile for to you go</li>
